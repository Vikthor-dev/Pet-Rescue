The Web App Pet Rescue is designed for animal lovers who use the application to help animals found outside without an owner find a new home.
The web app has two types of users: The "Person" user type refers to individuals who publish information about animals found outside and injured, aiming to find them temporary or permanent shelter. The "Shelter" user type represents an actual animal shelter, providing additional details about animals they wish to put up for adoption. Additionally, the application serves as an online community where "Person" users can share any information related to animals that may assist shelters and other pet owners. Technologies used: Vue.js Framework and Google Firebase.
